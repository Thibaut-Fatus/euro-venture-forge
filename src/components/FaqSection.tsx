    question: "How much does it cost to submit a project?",
    answer: "Project submission is completely free. If your project is selected for development, you'll only pay a fraction of the normal development costs, typically 20-30% of traditional agency rates."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my project is selected?",
    answer: "We'll contact you to discuss details, validate the problem further, and determine scope. Once we agree on terms, we'll begin development with regular updates and involvement from your team."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I earn revenue from my project?",
    answer: "When your solution is marketed to other businesses, you'll receive a percentage of the revenue, typically between 10-25% depending on your initial investment and the solution's success."
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of projects do you typically develop?",
    answer: "We focus on digital solutions that solve real problems for small businesses â€“ from appointment scheduling systems to inventory management, client portals, specialized accounting tools, and industry-specific workflow automation."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes a good project submission?",
    answer: "The best submissions identify a specific, well-defined problem that your business faces, that is likely shared by other businesses in your industry, and that doesn't have adequate solutions in the market today."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'European sovereignty' mean for my project?",
    answer: "It means your solution will be built using European infrastructure and software whenever possible, ensuring data remains under European jurisdiction and complies with EU regulations like GDPR."
